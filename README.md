# Linux playbook

## Why
Each time we setup a new linux server, we need to install some software. Instead of manually doing it, we can automate it. This is the purpose of this playbook.

## How
We will use plain and simple *javascript* to automate the installation of software.

## Steps
Run `setup-nvm.sh` to install the software. This will guide you through the installation process.
